## About ShareFrame
ShareFrame is a new project I am working on where developers can share their projects on the ShareFrame platform.

On ShareFrame, Developers will be able to:
- Share their projects
- Announce project updates
- Solve bugs
- Add contributors
- View popularity and other metrics

- Submit bugs
- Ask to contribute
- Message the developer
- View updates
- Answer polls and reviews (If developer has given you access)
- Comment on project updates
